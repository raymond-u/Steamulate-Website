            <p class="paragraph-custom">Dear user,<br><br>We're sorry to inform you that due to some unknown obstacle, our development team faced a payment issue when renewing Apple Developer Program membership, which means that during this period, Steamulate will be removed from the App Store. For users who have purchased, however, this doesn't affect your daily use, and if you ever need to re-download the app, please check your "Account - Purchased" page.<br><br>We apologize for any inconvenience caused. We will continue to communicate with Apple support and have Steamulate put back for sale as soon as possible.<br><br>If you have further questions, feel free to contact us at steamulate@eunoware.com.<br><br>Regards,<br>EunoWare</p>
