            <p class="paragraph-custom"><br>By using Steamulate (this app), you agree to our Terms of Use. This Terms of Use play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using Steamulate. Be sure to check back
                from time to time, as these policies may change.<br><br><strong>About Steam account</strong><br><br>We understand how important your account is and we're protecting it as much as we can. Your logon credentials will only be sent to valid
                Steam servers, or with your explicit consent, be uploaded to your personal iCloud storage in encrypted form. From time to time, your credentials are stored in encrypted form. Even we are not possible to extract them directly from the encrypted
                strings. So technically speaking, your account is kept safe from most of hacking attempts. However, do remember Steam has its own ToS and there is a very low possibility that they might take action if they think your behavior is against
                their ToS. Although if you use this app in a "standard" manner, these things should never happen to you. "Standard" here means you use the app as-is, with intended use case, and are not running a bunch of accounts simultaneously (roughly
                speaking, you should run no more than 20 bots in the same time, though we don't stop you from adding more). And you should not use the built-in command we provide to harass the other Steam users. In no circumstances shall we be liable
                for any claim, damages or other liability with regard to your Steam account.<br><br><strong>About Steamulate itself</strong><br><br>When downloading Steamulate from App Store, you should know that the copy you receive is for your personal
                use only and must not be shared with others. Specifically, as per App Store EULA, you should not have more than 10 accounts sharing the same copy. If we believed you violated this, your access to this app would be restricted.<br><br><strong>Declaration</strong><br><br>All
                trademarks are property of their respective owners in the US and other countries. We are not affiliated with Valve or Steam in any form.</p>
